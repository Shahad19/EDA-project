# Abstract

Ice Cream Trucks is a company that needs to explore the busiest areas of New York City.  This analysis will provide information about the busiest subway stations.  So, by analyzing the MTA Turnstile Data, we can help them explore where the Ice Cream Trucks should take a location. Then, we will make a recommendation regarding this analysis regarding the 10 busiest stations.

# Goals

- Determining the top 10 busiest stations to explore where should these trucks take location.

# Algorithms

Data analysis and visualization tools were used to read, clean, and visualize the data. the first step after read the data is cleaning data by handling missing values, deleting duplicated rows and unnecessary columns such as desc . Also, we added new columns (date-time, day-name), and strip all the names of columns to remove spaces. The second step of this project is to calculate the daily entries, daily exits, and traffic using the entries and exits columns. Finally, for data visualization, matplotlib and seaborn were used to create graphs.

# Data description

- The project used MTA turnstile data to analyze subway stations in New York City, the data is public and it is available on http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html
- This project used a selected sample of four months From May to Aug of 2018.

# Tools

- Jupyter Notbook.
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib

# Future Work

As a result, the trucks will be located to the 10 busiest stations to increase sales of the Ice Cream Trucks can be set based on when the temperatures are rising and during the rush hours.
